      <h1>Legal Declaration of Consent under Data Protection Law</h1>
      <!-- <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kyblab.tuebingen.mpg.de/fma/dataprotection.pdf">Please click here to view our Data Protection Information Sheet, yours to keep.</a></p>
      <p>I have received and took note of the written Data Protection Information Sheet for this study. In doing so, I had sufficient time and opportunity to ask questions about data protection and reconsider my participation in the study. </p>
      <p>I am aware that:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>the processing and use of the collected data occur in a pseudonymized form within the scope of the legally prescribed provisions.
              As a general rule, the storage occurs in the form of questionnaires, as well as on electronic data media, for 10 years
              or longer, if this is required by the purpose of the study.</li>
          <li>by providing further personal data in pseudonymized form, collected personal data may be used for the preparation of anonymized
              scientific research work and may also be published and used in an anonymized form in medical journals, scientific publications
              and publicly accessible scientific databases, so that a direct assignment to my person cannot be established.</li>
          <li>the information obtained during this study may also be sent in an anonymized form to cooperation partners within the
              scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation for scientific purposes and to cooperation partners outside of the
              European Union, i.e. to countries with a lower data protection level (this also applies to the USA).</li>
          <li>the data collected within the scope of the study can also be used and processed in the future inside of the Institute.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I was informed about my rights, that at any time:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>I can withdraw this declaration of consent.</li>
            <li>I can request information about my stored data and request the correction or blocking of data.</li>
            <li>by cancellation of my participation in the study, I can request that my personal data collected until that time are immediately deleted or anonymized.</li>
            <li>I can request that my data are handed out to me or to third parties (if technically feasible).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I herewith declare that:</p>
      <ul>
            <li>I have been adequately informed about the collection and processing of my data and rights.</li>
            <li>I consent to the collection and processing of personal data within the scope of the study and its pseudonymized disclosure so that
              only the persons conducting the study can establish a link between the data and my person.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By selecting the consent option below, I agree to participate in online studies or experiments using learning, and I consent to the use of my data described in the Data Protection Information Sheet and confirm having received a copy of the Data Protection Sheet.</p>
      <p>Note: If you do not consent to participate in this study or have your data used as outlined in the Data Protection Information Sheet, then this experiment will now close and you will not proceed any further. No information about you will be retained. </p>
